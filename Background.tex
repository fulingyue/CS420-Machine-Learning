\section{Prequisitions}
\subsection{ML's Goal}
Machine learning has a loss function $\mathcal{L}$, 
and we have to let it take the minimum by learning the parameters of $f_\theta$.
$$ 
\mathrm{min} \{\frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i = 1}^N \mathcal{L} (y_i,f_\theta(x_i))\}
$$


\subsection{Terminologies}
\paragraph{\textbf{Hyper-parameter}} Those parameters which are given artificially.
They cannot be determined by learning model.
